# Was Java EE a container orchestration framework?
I have been thinking about this lately.

I'm not expert in Spring, but that whole bean, component and service ideia seems to me pretty close to the microservice on containers idea.

Beans are just small data microservices.
Services are microservices

Autowire is just service discovery (done pretty damn right).

This ideia made me curious about how Java EE works, because if i'm right, we are reinventing the wheel here (in another dimension) and they can have some problems and solutions we don't even have yet.
